The PayPal X Payments Platform provides several Adaptive Payments APIs that enable you to provision payments through applications or services running on the Cloud. Using the PayPal X Payments Apex Toolkit, applications can handle payments, preapprovals for payments, refunds, and even use the Foreign Exchange currency conversion rates from Force.com platform. Please check https://www.X.com for more information about PayPal's Adaptive Payments APIs.

This project includes a Force.com Apex code package that can be installed in a SalesForce.com org to integrate with PayPal X Payments Platform, and make use of various API operations provided.

PayPal X Payments Platform Toolkit includes support for [Adaptive Payments](https://www.x.com/community/ppx/adaptive_payments) and [Adaptive Accounts](https://www.x.com/community/ppx/adaptive_accounts) APIs.
